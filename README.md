## DOMAIN ADAPTATION BASED ON OPTIMAL TRANSPORT FOR MI-BCI

You will find here all the codes and instructions you need in order to reproduce the experiments performed in "Transfer Learning Based on Optimal Transport for MI-BCI", by Victoria Peterson, Diego H. Milone, Dominik Wyser, Olivier Lambercy, Roger Gassert and Ruben Spies.

We provide here two examples, each one for each online testing scenario considered in our study.
